# Exeter-Dorm-Websites
Create websites for each dorm. We will provide a general template for individuals in dorms to take and personalize for their dorm. With our brainstorming so far, we are thinking of implementing the following...

Features:\
-Already created sign-in for privacy\
-List of upcoming dorm events\
-Who's on duty (for the day and upcoming)\
-Dorm birthdays (for the day and upcoming)\
-Dorm tutors (Using @TheOneOba's project)\
-Dorm news/announcements\
-Dorm repair form (info will be sent to dorm heads)\
-Dorm funding request form (that is normally sent by stuco)\
-Dorm photos\
-Washer & Dryer availability (from Components Programming Group project)\
-Dorm merch\
-StuList and Proctor info\
-Seperate form for proctors, stulis, & faculty to submit some of the above\
-Form for proctor elections (candidates)

It will basically serve to collect all the clutter we get in emails, info posted on walls, and so much more!

## Getting started
We will use the Python library Flask as our framework.

Simply run the app.py file to start the website and then follow the url.
